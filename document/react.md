# ### MUI uses Emotion's CSS-in-JS capabilities to style its components. This package is necessary for the underlying styling engine.
# @emotion/styled: 
# ### This provides a styled-components-like API, which MUI uses internally and which you can also use to create your own styled components that integrate well with MUI's theming system.
