# W function

In mathematics, the **W function** is often used to refer to the **Lambert W function**. It is a special function that solves equations involving exponentials and logarithms. Specifically, the Lambert W function is defined as the inverse of the function:

**f(w) = w * e^w**

This means that if you have an equation of the form:

**x = w * e^w**

then the Lambert W function, written as **W(x)**, gives the value of **w**. In other words:

**w = W(x)**.

### Properties of the Lambert W Function:
1. **Multiple Branches**:
    - The Lambert W function has multiple branches, but the two most commonly used are:
        - **Principal branch (W₀)**: This is the branch that is real for values of x ≥ -1/e.
        - **Secondary branch (W₋₁)**: This is the branch that is real for -1/e ≤ x < 0.

2. **Domain**:
    - The function is defined for real values of **x** where **x ≥ -1/e** for the principal branch (W₀).
    - For the secondary branch (W₋₁), it is defined for **-1/e ≤ x < 0**.

3. **Applications**:
    - The Lambert W function is commonly used in problems involving exponential growth or decay.
    - It appears in physics, engineering, combinatorics, and computer science.

### Examples:
1. Solve for **w** in the equation:
   **w * e^w = 2.**

   Using the Lambert W function:
   **w = W(2).**

2. Solve for **x** in the equation:
   **e^x = 5x.**

   Taking the natural logarithm and rearranging:
   **x * e^x = 5.**
   Using the Lambert W function:
   **x = W(5).**

### Graph of the Lambert W Function:
Below is a rough description of the behavior:
- For the principal branch (**W₀**), the function is real and increasing for **x ≥ -1/e**, starting at **W₀(-1/e) = -1**.
- For the secondary branch (**W₋₁**), the function decreases for **-1/e ≤ x < 0**, starting at **W₋₁(-1/e) = -1** and approaching negative infinity as **x → 0⁻**.

### Approximation:
For small values of **x**, the Lambert W function can be approximated as:

**W(x) ≈ x - x² + (3/2)x³** (for x close to 0).

# More

In mathematics, the **W function** refers to the **Lambert W function**, a special function that is the inverse of \( f(W) = W e^W \), where \( W \) is the unknown. In other words, the Lambert W function solves equations of the form:

$$
x = W e^W
$$

for \( W \) in terms of \( x \). It is denoted as \( W(x) \).

### Key Properties of the Lambert W Function
1. **Inverse Relationship**: If $ y = W(x) $, then $ x = y e^y $.
2. **Multiple Branches**: For certain values of $ x $, there are multiple solutions for $ W(x) $. These are called branches:
    - **Principal Branch** $( W_0(x) )$: The branch that is real and defined for $ x \geq -\frac{1}{e} $.
    - **Secondary Branch** $( W_{-1}(x) )$: The branch that is real and defined for $ -\frac{1}{e} \leq x < 0 $.
3. **Special Values**:
    - $ W(0) = 0 $
    - $ W(-\frac{1}{e}) = -1 $

### Applications
The Lambert W function is used in various fields of mathematics and science, including:
- Solving transcendental equations like $ x^x = a $
- Analyzing exponential growth and decay
- Physics problems involving quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics
- Computer science for analyzing algorithms and combinatorial structures

### Example
Solve $ x e^x = 2 $.

1. Rewrite the equation as $ x = W(2) $.
2. Use the Lambert W function to find $ x \approx 0.8526 $ (on the principal branch $ W_0 $).
