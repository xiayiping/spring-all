# Delegate

In C#, a **delegate** is a type that represents a method signature and can be used to reference methods with that specific signature. It acts as a type-safe function pointer, allowing you to pass methods as parameters, store them in variables, or call them dynamically.

Here's an explanation of your example:

```csharp
internal delegate void abc(int a);
```

### What Does This Declaration Mean?

1. **`internal`**: The `internal` access modifier means this delegate can only be accessed within the same assembly.
2. **`delegate`**: This keyword is used to define a delegate type.
3. **`void`**: The delegate specifies a return type of `void`, meaning it doesn't return any value.
4. **`abc(int a)`**: The delegate specifies a method signature that takes a single parameter of type `int`.

So, `abc` is a delegate type that can represent any method that takes an `int` as a parameter and returns nothing.

### How to Use a Delegate?

#### 1. **Define a Delegate**
The delegate `abc` is already defined in your example.

```csharp
internal delegate void abc(int a);
```

#### 2. **Create a Method Matching the Signature**
Create a method with the same signature as the delegate.

```csharp
void PrintNumber(int number)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Number: {number}");
}
```

#### 3. **Instantiate the Delegate**
You can create an instance of the delegate and assign it to reference the `PrintNumber` method.

```csharp
abc myDelegate = PrintNumber;
```

#### 4. **Invoke the Delegate**
Call the delegate just like a method.

```csharp
myDelegate(42); // Output: Number: 42
```

---

### Full Example
Here’s a complete example of defining and using the `abc` delegate:

```csharp
using System;

internal delegate void abc(int a);

class Program
{
    static void PrintNumber(int number)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Number: {number}");
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        // Instantiate the delegate and assign the method
        abc myDelegate = PrintNumber;

        // Invoke the delegate
        myDelegate(42); // Output: Number: 42
    }
}
```

---

### Using Anonymous Methods or Lambdas with Delegates
Instead of defining a separate method, you can use **anonymous methods** or **lambda expressions**.

#### Using an Anonymous Method:
```csharp
abc myDelegate = delegate (int number)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Anonymous Number: {number}");
};
myDelegate(100); // Output: Anonymous Number: 100
```

#### Using a Lambda Expression:
```csharp
abc myDelegate = (int number) => Console.WriteLine($"Lambda Number: {number}");
myDelegate(200); // Output: Lambda Number: 200
```

---

### Key Points About Delegates in C#:

1. **Type-Safe**: Delegates ensure that the method signature matches the delegate type, providing compile-time safety.
2. **Multicast Delegates**: A delegate can reference more than one method. When invoked, all the referenced methods are executed.

   ```csharp
   abc myDelegate = PrintNumber;
   myDelegate += (number) => Console.WriteLine($"Second Method: {number}");
   myDelegate(300);
   // Output:
   // Number: 300
   // Second Method: 300
   ```

3. **Built-in Delegates**: C# provides predefined delegate types like:
    - `Action<T>`: Represents a method with no return value.
    - `Func<T, TResult>`: Represents a method that returns a value.
    - `Predicate<T>`: Represents a method that returns a `bool`.

   Instead of creating custom delegates, you can often use these built-in types.

### When to Use Delegates?
Delegates are useful in scenarios like:
- **Event Handling**: Delegates are the foundation of C# event handling.
- **Callback Methods**: Passing methods as parameters to other methods.
- **Dynamic Method Invocation**: Choosing which method to execute at runtime.

# Delegate with Event

In C#, the `event` keyword is used in combination with a **delegate** to create an **event**. An event is a messaging system that allows a class (the publisher) to notify other classes or objects (the subscribers) when something happens.

### What Does `public event abc onAbc` Mean?

Here is a breakdown:

```csharp
public event abc onAbc;
```

1. **`public`**: The event is accessible from outside the class.
2. **`event`**: The `event` keyword specifies that `onAbc` is an event.
3. **`abc`**: This is the delegate type you defined earlier. It defines the method signature that subscribers must match.
4. **`onAbc`**: This is the name of the event.

This means that `onAbc` is an event, and other parts of your program can subscribe to it by providing methods that match the `abc` delegate's signature. When the event is triggered, all the subscribed methods will be invoked.

---

### How Events Work

Here’s how this would work step by step:

#### 1. Define the Delegate
The delegate defines the signature of the methods that can handle the event:

```csharp
internal delegate void abc(int a);
```

#### 2. Declare an Event
The `onAbc` event is declared using the delegate:

```csharp
public event abc onAbc;
```

#### 3. Raise the Event
The class that defines the event is responsible for "raising" (or "firing") the event. This is done by invoking the event, which calls all the subscribed methods.

#### 4. Subscribe to the Event
Other parts of the program can subscribe to the event by adding methods to it (using `+=`).

---

### Full Example

Here’s a complete example:

```csharp
using System;

internal delegate void abc(int a);

class Publisher
{
    // Declare an event based on the delegate
    public event abc onAbc;

    // Method to raise the event
    public void TriggerEvent(int value)
    {
        if (onAbc != null)
        {
            onAbc(value); // Call all subscribed methods
        }
    }
}

class Subscriber
{
    public void HandleEvent(int number)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Subscriber received: {number}");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Publisher publisher = new Publisher();
        Subscriber subscriber = new Subscriber();

        // Subscribe to the event
        publisher.onAbc += subscriber.HandleEvent;

        // Trigger the event
        publisher.TriggerEvent(42);
        // Output: Subscriber received: 42
    }
}
```

---

### Key Points in the Example

1. **Event Declaration**:
   ```csharp
   public event abc onAbc;
   ```
   The `onAbc` event is tied to the `abc` delegate. It can hold references to methods that match the signature `void (int)`.

2. **Subscribing to the Event**:
   ```csharp
   publisher.onAbc += subscriber.HandleEvent;
   ```
   The `+=` operator is used to attach the `HandleEvent` method to the `onAbc` event. You can add multiple methods, and they'll all be called when the event is triggered.

3. **Raising the Event**:
   ```csharp
   onAbc(value);
   ```
   The event is invoked like a method, and all subscribed methods are called in the order they were added.

4. **Null Check**:
   Before raising the event, it's common to check if the event has any subscribers:
   ```csharp
   if (onAbc != null)
   {
       onAbc(value);
   }
   ```

### Multiple Subscribers Example

You can have multiple methods subscribed to the same event. For example:

```csharp
class Subscriber1
{
    public void HandleEvent(int number)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Subscriber1 received: {number}");
    }
}

class Subscriber2
{
    public void HandleEvent(int number)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Subscriber2 received: {number}");
    }
}
```

In the `Main` method:

```csharp
Publisher publisher = new Publisher();
Subscriber1 sub1 = new Subscriber1();
Subscriber2 sub2 = new Subscriber2();

// Subscribe both methods to the event
publisher.onAbc += sub1.HandleEvent;
publisher.onAbc += sub2.HandleEvent;

// Trigger the event
publisher.TriggerEvent(100);
```

**Output**:
```
Subscriber1 received: 100
Subscriber2 received: 100
```

---

### Removing Subscriptions

You can unsubscribe from an event using the `-=` operator:

```csharp
publisher.onAbc -= sub1.HandleEvent;
```

This removes `sub1.HandleEvent` from the list of subscribed methods.

---

### Why Use Events?

1. **Decoupling**: Events allow the publisher and subscribers to remain loosely coupled. The publisher doesn't need to know about the subscribers, only that they match the delegate's signature.
2. **Multicast**: Multiple subscribers can handle the same event.
3. **Encapsulation**: Events only expose subscription (`+=`) and unsubscription (`-=`) functionality, ensuring that only the publisher can raise the event.
