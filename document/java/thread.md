# park vs yield

The methods `LockSupport.park()` and `Thread.yield()` in Java are both related to thread management, but they serve **completely different purposes**. Here's a detailed comparison of the two methods to highlight their differences:

---

### **Key Differences Between `LockSupport.park()` and `Thread.yield()`**

| **Aspect**                  | **`LockSupport.park()`**                               | **`Thread.yield()`**                                |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                 | Used to block a thread indefinitely or until explicitly unparked. | Hints to the scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its CPU time to other threads. |
| **Blocking Behavior**       | Puts the thread into a **waiting state** until explicitly unparked by another thread or interrupted. | Does **not block** the thread; only suggests to the scheduler to move the thread to the runnable queue. |
| **Wake-Up Mechanism**       | Requires an explicit call to `LockSupport.unpark(thread)` or an interrupt to wake up the thread. | The thread may regain CPU time immediately if no other threads of equal or higher priority are runnable. |
| **Thread State**            | Moves the thread to a **waiting state**.              | The thread remains in the **runnable state**, meaning it is still eligible for CPU scheduling. |
| **Duration**                | Indefinite, until explicitly unparked or interrupted. | Immediate; the thread may yield the CPU and regain it almost instantly. |
| **Control**                 | Provides precise, low-level control for thread suspension and resumption. | Relies on the operating system's scheduler to decide if the thread should yield the CPU. |
| **Use Case**                | Advanced synchronization (e.g., in locks, semaphores, or barriers). | Cooperative multitasking or allowing other threads to proceed in a CPU-intensive application. |

### **Detailed Comparison**

#### **1. Purpose**
- **`LockSupport.park()`**:
    - Designed for **thread synchronization**. It is commonly used in low-level concurrency constructs, such as `ReentrantLock`, `Semaphore`, and `CountDownLatch`.
    - The thread remains parked (blocked) until explicitly **unparked** using `LockSupport.unpark(thread)` or interrupted.

- **`Thread.yield()`**:
    - Used to **signal the scheduler** that the current thread is willing to yield its CPU time to other threads of the same or higher priority.
    - It is a **hint** to the operating system's scheduler and does not guarantee that the thread will actually yield; the thread may continue running immediately if no other threads are eligible.

---

#### **2. Blocking vs. Non-Blocking**
- **`LockSupport.park()`**:
    - Completely blocks the thread and moves it to a **waiting state**.
    - The thread consumes **no CPU resources** while it is parked.

- **`Thread.yield()`**:
    - Does not block the thread. The thread remains in the **runnable state**, meaning it is still eligible to run if the scheduler decides to grant it CPU time.
    - The thread may yield the CPU and immediately regain it if no other threads are ready to run.

---

#### **3. Wake-Up Mechanism**
- **`LockSupport.park()`**:
    - The thread remains parked until:
        - It is explicitly **unparked** by another thread using `LockSupport.unpark(thread)`.
        - It is **interrupted**.
    - This gives precise control over thread suspension and resumption.

- **`Thread.yield()`**:
    - No explicit wake-up mechanism is needed because the thread never stops running; it only signals the scheduler to potentially let other threads run.
    - The scheduler may choose to ignore the yield request.

---

#### **4. Thread State**
- **`LockSupport.park()`**:
    - Moves the thread to a **waiting state**, where it is not eligible for CPU scheduling until unparked or interrupted.

- **`Thread.yield()`**:
    - The thread remains in the **runnable state**, meaning it is still eligible for CPU scheduling.

---

#### **5. Duration**
- **`LockSupport.park()`**:
    - The thread can remain parked **indefinitely** until it is explicitly unparked or interrupted.

- **`Thread.yield()`**:
    - The thread yields the CPU **immediately** but is eligible to run again in the next CPU scheduling cycle.

---

#### **6. Control Over Execution**
- **`LockSupport.park()`**:
    - Provides **explicit control** over when a thread suspends and resumes. It is deterministic in behavior: the thread will remain parked until explicitly unparked.

- **`Thread.yield()`**:
    - Relies on the **scheduler's decision** to determine when the CPU is allocated to the thread again. This makes it non-deterministic.

---

#### **7. Use Cases**
- **`LockSupport.park()`**:
    - Ideal for advanced thread synchronization and coordination.
    - Commonly used in the implementation of:
        - Locks (`ReentrantLock`).
        - Semaphores.
        - Task queues and thread pools.
        - Barriers and other concurrency primitives.

- **`Thread.yield()`**:
    - Used to allow other threads to make progress in cooperative multitasking scenarios.
    - For example:
        - During CPU-intensive tasks, a thread may yield to allow other threads to proceed.
        - It can also be used in debugging or testing to simulate different thread scheduling scenarios.

---

### **Examples**

#### **Example: `LockSupport.park()`**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport;

public class ParkExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Thread is parking...");
            LockSupport.park(); // Thread will block here
            System.out.println("Thread is unparked and resumes execution.");
        });

        thread.start();

        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate some work in the main thread
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }

        System.out.println("Main thread is unparking the parked thread.");
        LockSupport.unpark(thread); // Unblock the thread
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
Thread is parking...
Main thread is unparking the parked thread.
Thread is unparked and resumes execution.
```

---

#### **Example: `Thread.yield()`**
```java
public class YieldExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - Iteration " + i);
                Thread.yield(); // Hint to the scheduler
            }
        };

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task, "Thread-1");
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task, "Thread-2");

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

**Output** (may vary):
```
Thread-1 - Iteration 0
Thread-2 - Iteration 0
Thread-1 - Iteration 1
Thread-2 - Iteration 1
...
```

### **When to Use Which?**

- **Use `LockSupport.park()`**:
    - When implementing advanced synchronization mechanisms like custom locks, semaphores, or thread barriers.
    - When precise control over thread suspension and resumption is required.

- **Use `Thread.yield()`**:
    - When you want to give other threads a chance to execute in a CPU-intensive application.
    - When you want to simulate cooperative multitasking or influence the scheduling behavior of threads.

Both methods have their specific use cases, and understanding the difference is crucial for writing efficient multithreaded applications.


# park vs sleep

The methods `LockSupport.park()` and `Thread.sleep()` in Java are both used to suspend the execution of a thread, but they serve different purposes and behave differently in terms of how they manage thread states, interruptions, and wake-up mechanisms. Here's a detailed comparison:

---

### **1. Purpose**

| **Feature**         | **`LockSupport.park()`**                                | **`Thread.sleep()`**                           |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Purpose**  | Used for advanced thread synchronization or coordination, typically in low-level concurrency constructs. | Used to pause a thread for a specified amount of time. |
| **Usage Context**    | Commonly used in frameworks or libraries that implement locks, semaphores, or other synchronization primitives. | Used in applications to introduce delays (e.g., periodic polling, throttling, or time-based operations). |

---

### **2. Thread Suspension**

| **Feature**         | **`LockSupport.park()`**                                | **`Thread.sleep()`**                           |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Blocking Behavior**| Parks the thread indefinitely until it is explicitly unparked or interrupted. | Suspends the thread for a specified duration (e.g., milliseconds). |
| **Wake-Up Mechanism**| The thread can only be explicitly woken up using `LockSupport.unpark(thread)` or by being interrupted. | The thread automatically wakes up after the specified sleep duration or if interrupted. |

---

### **3. Relation to Locks/Synchronization**

| **Feature**          | **`LockSupport.park()`**                               | **`Thread.sleep()`**                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Associated with Locks** | Designed for use in lock-free synchronization mechanisms. It operates independently of intrinsic locks or monitors. | Not related to locks or synchronization. It just pauses the thread for a fixed time. |
| **Permit System**     | Maintains a "permit" internally. If the thread has a permit, `park()` will return immediately without blocking. | Does not use a permit system. Always blocks for the specified duration (or until interrupted). |

---

### **4. Interrupt Handling**

| **Feature**          | **`LockSupport.park()`**                               | **`Thread.sleep()`**                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Interrupt Behavior**| If the thread is interrupted while parked, it will unblock but will not throw an exception. The thread's interrupt status remains set. | If the thread is interrupted while sleeping, it throws an `InterruptedException`, and the thread's interrupt status is cleared. |
| **Interrupt Use Case**| Suitable when you want to handle interruptions manually by checking the thread's interrupt status. | Suitable when interruptions are expected to terminate the sleep early and exceptions are handled directly. |

---

### **5. Fairness and Ordering**

| **Feature**          | **`LockSupport.park()`**                               | **`Thread.sleep()`**                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Fairness**          | No fairness guarantees. If multiple threads are parked, the order of unparking is determined by the calling code. | Not applicable, as threads wake up automatically after the specified time. |
| **Thread Ordering**   | Does not guarantee the order in which threads are unparked unless explicitly managed. | Not applicable, as threads resume after the sleep duration independently. |

---

### **6. Use Cases**

| **Feature**          | **`LockSupport.park()`**                               | **`Thread.sleep()`**                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Typical Use Cases** | - Used in the implementation of locks, semaphores, and other synchronization tools (e.g., `ReentrantLock` uses `park()` internally).<br>- Used to block a thread until explicitly woken up (e.g., thread coordination). | - Introduce delays in applications (e.g., throttling, polling loops).<br>- Implement scheduled tasks (when combined with time-based logic). |

---

### **7. Examples**

#### **Example of `LockSupport.park()`**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport;

public class ParkExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Thread is parking...");
            LockSupport.park(); // Thread will block here until unparked
            System.out.println("Thread is unparked and resumes execution.");
        });

        thread.start();

        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate some work in the main thread
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }

        System.out.println("Main thread is unparking the parked thread.");
        LockSupport.unpark(thread); // Unblock the thread
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Thread is parking...
Main thread is unparking the parked thread.
Thread is unparked and resumes execution.
```

##### **Key Notes**:
- The thread remains parked indefinitely until explicitly unparked by another thread.
- `LockSupport.park()` is commonly used in lock implementations and frameworks.

---

#### **Example of `Thread.sleep()`**
```java
public class SleepExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                System.out.println("Thread is sleeping for 2 seconds...");
                Thread.sleep(2000); // Thread will sleep for 2 seconds
                System.out.println("Thread wakes up and resumes execution.");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Thread was interrupted during sleep.");
            }
        });

        thread.start();
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Thread is sleeping for 2 seconds...
Thread wakes up and resumes execution.
```

##### **Key Notes**:
- The thread automatically resumes after the specified sleep duration.
- If the thread is interrupted during sleep, it throws an `InterruptedException`.

---

### **Summary of Differences**

| **Aspect**              | **`LockSupport.park()`**                               | **`Thread.sleep()`**                           |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Duration**             | Indefinite (until explicitly unparked or interrupted). | Fixed duration (specified in milliseconds).   |
| **Wake-up Mechanism**    | Explicitly unparked using `LockSupport.unpark()`.      | Automatically wakes up after the sleep time.  |
| **Interrupt Behavior**   | Does not throw an exception, but sets the interrupt flag. | Throws `InterruptedException` if interrupted. |
| **Use Case**             | Advanced synchronization and thread coordination.      | Introducing time-based delays in execution.   |
| **Relation to Synchronization** | Used in lock-free synchronization frameworks.         | Not associated with synchronization.          |

---

### **When to Use Which?**

- **Use `LockSupport.park()`**:
    - For advanced thread synchronization, such as implementing locks, semaphores, or condition variables.
    - When you need precise control over when a thread suspends and resumes.
    - In custom thread management frameworks or concurrent utilities.

- **Use `Thread.sleep()`**:
    - When you need to pause a thread for a specific amount of time.
    - For simple time delays, such as in polling loops, animations, or throttling operations.
    - When thread suspension is based on elapsed time rather than external signals.

--- 

### **Conclusion**
`LockSupport.park()` is a low-level mechanism designed for fine-grained thread coordination and synchronization, while `Thread.sleep()` is a simpler, higher-level method for introducing timed delays. Both have their own specific use cases, and understanding their differences is crucial for writing efficient multithreaded applications.


# volatile and half read

In Java, the `volatile` keyword is used to ensure **visibility** and **atomicity** of references. When a `volatile` variable is assigned a new object, it prevents **half-read** or **partially constructed objects** from being visible to other threads. Here's how `volatile` achieves this:

---

### **What is a Half-Read Problem?**
- A **half-read** problem occurs when a thread reads a reference to an object that has not been fully initialized or constructed yet.
- In a multithreaded environment, one thread may be writing to a shared variable (e.g., assigning it a new object), while another thread might try to read the variable before the assignment is complete.
- Without proper synchronization, the reading thread might see a **partially constructed object**, leading to undefined or incorrect behavior.

---

### **How `volatile` Prevents Half-Reads**

The `volatile` keyword ensures that:
1. **Happens-Before Relationship**:
    - In Java's memory model, writing to a `volatile` variable establishes a **happens-before** relationship with subsequent reads of that variable by other threads.
    - This guarantees that when a thread reads a `volatile` reference, it **always sees the fully constructed object**, as all writes to that object (by the thread that created it) happen-before the `volatile` write.

2. **Memory Visibility**:
    - Writing to a `volatile` variable ensures that any changes made to the object by the writing thread are **flushed to main memory** before the reference is updated.
    - Reading the `volatile` variable ensures that the thread fetches the most up-to-date value from main memory, rather than using a stale value from its local CPU cache.

3. **Atomic Reference Update**:
    - Assigning a new object to a `volatile` variable is an **atomic operation**. Other threads will either see the old reference or the fully updated new reference, but never a partially updated value.

---

### **Example Without `volatile` (Half-Read Issue)**

```java
class SharedData {
    int x;

    SharedData() {
        x = 42; // Initialization
    }
}

class Example {
    private static SharedData sharedData; // Non-volatile reference

    public static void writerThread() {
        sharedData = new SharedData(); // Assign a new object
    }

    public static void readerThread() {
        if (sharedData != null) {
            System.out.println(sharedData.x); // May print 0 due to half-read
        }
    }
}
```

#### **What Can Go Wrong?**
- The `writerThread` assigns a new `SharedData` object to `sharedData`.
- Without `volatile`, the reference update (`sharedData = new SharedData()`) and the initialization (`x = 42`) may be reordered or partially visible to other threads.
- The `readerThread` may see the reference to the new object (`sharedData != null` evaluates to `true`) but may read uninitialized fields (`sharedData.x` may still be `0`).

---

### **Example With `volatile` (Safe Publishing)**

```java
class SharedData {
    int x;

    SharedData() {
        x = 42; // Initialization
    }
}

class Example {
    private static volatile SharedData sharedData; // Volatile reference

    public static void writerThread() {
        sharedData = new SharedData(); // Assign a new object
    }

    public static void readerThread() {
        if (sharedData != null) {
            System.out.println(sharedData.x); // Always prints 42
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Why This Works**
1. The `writerThread`:
    - Creates a new `SharedData` object (`new SharedData()`).
    - Fully initializes the object (e.g., `x = 42`).
    - Writes the reference to `sharedData` as a `volatile` variable.
    - The `volatile` write ensures the reference to the fully constructed object is visible to other threads.

2. The `readerThread`:
    - Reads the `volatile` reference (`sharedData`).
    - Because of the **happens-before relationship**, the `readerThread` always sees the fully initialized object (with `x = 42`).

---

### **How `volatile` Works Under the Hood**
1. **Memory Barriers**:
    - The Java Memory Model (JMM) ensures that `volatile` writes insert a **store barrier** and `volatile` reads insert a **load barrier**.
    - These barriers prevent reordering of instructions around the `volatile` access and ensure visibility across threads.

   For example:
    - A **store barrier** ensures that all writes to memory by the current thread are visible before the `volatile` write.
    - A **load barrier** ensures that all reads happen after the `volatile` read.

2. **Cache Coherency**:
    - Modern CPUs use caches to improve performance, but this can lead to stale values in a multithreaded environment.
    - `volatile` ensures that changes made to a `volatile` variable are immediately visible to all threads by enforcing **cache coherency protocols** (e.g., MESI protocol).

---

### **When to Use `volatile`**
- Use `volatile` when:
    1. You need to ensure **safe publication** of a newly constructed object.
    2. The variable is accessed by multiple threads **without modification** to the object's internal state after it is initialized.
    3. A lightweight synchronization mechanism is sufficient (e.g., avoiding the overhead of locks).

- Do **not** use `volatile` if:
    - Multiple threads modify the variable or the object's internal state concurrently.
    - You need atomic compound actions (like `check-then-update`), which require locks or `Atomic` classes.

---

### **Summary**
- A `volatile` reference avoids half-reads of an object by guaranteeing **visibility** and **atomicity** of the reference assignment.
- It ensures that:
    - The new object is fully initialized before the reference is updated.
    - Other threads reading the `volatile` reference always see the fully constructed object.
- This is achieved through **memory barriers** and **cache coherency protocols**, which prevent instruction reordering and stale reads.
