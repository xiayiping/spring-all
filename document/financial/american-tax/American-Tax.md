# Form 144

### **What Is Form 144?**

**Form 144** is a document that must be filed with the **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** by certain insiders of publicly traded companies when they plan to sell restricted, unregistered, or control securities. It is a regulatory requirement under **Rule 144** of the Securities Act of 1933, which governs the public resale of such securities.

---

### **Key Details About Form 144**

#### **1. Who Needs to File Form 144?**
- **Insiders** of a company:
    - This includes **officers**, **directors**, or individuals who own more than **10% of the company's voting stock**.
- These insiders must file Form 144 **if they intend to sell restricted or control securities** in the open market.

#### **2. What Are Restricted and Control Securities?**
- **Restricted Securities**:
    - These are securities acquired in private transactions (e.g., stock options, private placements) and are not registered with the SEC.
- **Control Securities**:
    - These are securities held by insiders (officers, directors, or significant shareholders) who have control over the company.

#### **3. Filing Thresholds**
Form 144 must be filed **if the sale meets both of the following conditions**:
- The sale involves **5,000 shares or more**, OR
- The aggregate sale price exceeds **$50,000** within a three-month period.

#### **4. Purpose of Form 144**
- It is a **notice of intent** to sell securities, not an approval process.
- The purpose is to **promote transparency** and prevent insider trading or market manipulation by notifying the SEC and the public of significant insider sales.

#### **5. Filing Timeline**
- Form 144 must be filed **at the time of, or prior to, the sale** of the securities.

---

### **Does Form 144 Impact Non-U.S. People?**

The impact of **Form 144** on non-U.S. persons depends on their relationship to the company and the type of securities they hold. Here’s an analysis:

#### **1. Non-U.S. Persons as Insiders**
- If a **non-U.S. person** is an insider (e.g., a director, officer, or large shareholder of a U.S.-listed company), they are subject to the same SEC rules as U.S. insiders.
- They would need to file **Form 144** before selling restricted or control securities in the U.S. markets, just like U.S. citizens.

#### **2. Non-U.S. Persons Not Classified as Insiders**
- If a non-U.S. person is **not an insider** of a U.S. company and holds securities that are **not restricted or control securities**, they are **not impacted** by Form 144.
- For example:
    - A **non-U.S. investor buying publicly traded U.S. stocks on the open market** does not need to file Form 144 when selling those stocks.

#### **3. Non-U.S. Companies with U.S. Listings**
- If a non-U.S. person holds restricted or control securities in a **foreign company listed on a U.S. stock exchange**, Form 144 may still apply if the sale occurs in the U.S. markets and they are classified as an insider of that company.

#### **4. Non-U.S. Market Transactions**
- If the sale of securities occurs **outside the U.S. markets** (e.g., on a foreign stock exchange), and the transaction does not involve U.S. investors or markets, Form 144 is typically **not required**.

---

### **Practical Example**

#### Example 1: Non-U.S. Insider of a U.S.-Listed Company
- You are a **director** of a U.S.-listed company and hold **restricted stock** received as part of your compensation.
- If you plan to sell more than 5,000 shares or $50,000 worth of stock in a three-month period, you must file **Form 144** with the SEC before the sale.

#### Example 2: Non-U.S. Retail Investor
- You are a retail investor living outside the U.S. and own public shares of a U.S.-listed company (purchased on the open market).
- When you sell these shares, **Form 144 does not apply**, because you are not an insider, and the shares are not restricted or control securities.

---

### **Summary**

- **Form 144** is relevant only to **insiders** (officers, directors, or large shareholders) of a U.S.-listed company or a foreign company listed on a U.S. exchange.
- It primarily affects individuals selling **restricted or control securities**.
- For most **non-U.S. investors** who are not insiders or who hold publicly traded securities, **Form 144 has no impact**.
- However, **non-U.S. insiders of U.S.-listed companies** are subject to the same reporting requirements as U.S. insiders.

# Withholding Tax

### **What Is Withholding Tax?**

**Withholding tax** is a tax that is deducted at the source of income before the payment is made to the recipient. It is a way for governments to collect taxes on income, dividends, interest, or other payments **at the time the payment is made**, rather than waiting for the recipient to declare the income on their tax return.

The entity making the payment (e.g., an employer, company, or financial institution) is responsible for deducting the tax and remitting it to the tax authorities. The recipient receives the remaining amount after the withholding tax has been deducted.

---

### **Key Characteristics of Withholding Tax**

1. **Collected at Source**: Tax is withheld directly by the payer before the payment is made to the recipient.
2. **Prepaid Tax**: It is considered an advance payment of the recipient's income tax liability.
3. **Varies by Jurisdiction**: Withholding tax rules and rates vary depending on the country and type of income.
4. **Applicable to Various Types of Income**: It applies to salaries, dividends, interest, royalties, and other forms of income.

---

### **Types of Withholding Tax**

#### **1. Employee Income Tax Withholding**
- **Purpose**: Employers deduct income tax from an employee’s paycheck and remit it to the tax authorities.
- **Example**: In the U.S., employers withhold **federal income tax**, **state income tax** (if applicable), and **social security/Medicare taxes** under the **Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)**.

#### **2. Nonresident Withholding Tax**
- **Purpose**: Applied to payments made to nonresidents (foreign individuals or entities) on **U.S.-sourced income** (or other countries with similar systems).
- **Examples of Income Subject to Withholding**:
    - Dividends from U.S. stocks.
    - Royalties for intellectual property used in the U.S.
    - Interest payments from U.S. companies.
    - Payments for services performed in the U.S. by foreign contractors.
- **Default Rate**: Often **30%** in the U.S. (can be reduced under a tax treaty).

#### **3. Withholding Tax on Investment Income**
- Applicable to **dividends**, **interest**, and **other investment returns**.
- Example: If a nonresident owns U.S. stocks, the dividend payments may be subject to withholding tax at a **default rate of 30%**, unless reduced by a tax treaty.

#### **4. Backup Withholding**
- **Purpose**: Imposed when a taxpayer fails to provide a valid **Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)** (e.g., on Form W-9 in the U.S.).
- **Rate**: The backup withholding rate in the U.S. is generally **24%** of the payment.

---

### **Withholding Tax in International Context**

#### **For Nonresidents**
- Nonresidents earning income from a foreign country are often subject to withholding tax at the source. For example:
    - In the **U.S.**, a **30% tax** is withheld on U.S.-sourced income for nonresidents unless a tax treaty applies.
    - Tax treaties between countries often **reduce withholding tax rates** on certain types of income (e.g., dividends, royalties, or interest).
    - Nonresidents must complete forms like **W-8BEN** to claim tax treaty benefits.

#### **Tax Treaty Benefits**
- Many countries have **tax treaties** that reduce or eliminate withholding taxes for residents of treaty countries.
- Example: A Chinese investor earning dividends from a U.S. company may have their withholding tax reduced from **30%** to **10%** under the U.S.-China tax treaty.

---

### **Examples of Withholding Tax**

1. **Salary Income**:
    - An employer deducts **income tax** from an employee’s paycheck and remits it to the government. For example, in the U.S., federal and state income taxes are withheld along with social security and Medicare contributions.

2. **Dividends for Foreign Investors**:
    - A non-U.S. resident holding U.S. stocks earns $1,000 in dividends.
    - The U.S. company withholds **30%** ($300) and sends it to the IRS.
    - The investor receives the remaining **$700**.

3. **Royalties Paid to a Nonresident**:
    - A U.S. company pays $5,000 to a foreign entity for the use of intellectual property.
    - The default withholding rate is **30%**, but if the foreign entity files a **W-8BEN** and a tax treaty applies, the rate may be reduced to **10%**.

---

### **Why Withholding Tax Matters**

1. **For Governments**:
    - Ensures timely tax collection.
    - Reduces the risk of tax evasion by taxing income at the source.

2. **For Taxpayers**:
    - Acts as a prepayment of taxes owed.
    - Taxpayers may be eligible for refunds if the withheld amount exceeds their actual tax liability.

3. **For Nonresidents**:
    - Withholding tax directly affects the net income they receive from foreign sources.
    - Filing the appropriate forms (e.g., **W-8BEN**) is critical to reduce unnecessary tax withholding.

---

### **Withholding Tax vs. Income Tax**

| **Aspect**              | **Withholding Tax**                         | **Income Tax**                                |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Timing**              | Collected at the time of payment.           | Paid after filing a tax return.              |
| **Who Collects It?**    | Deducted by the payer (e.g., employer, bank).| Paid directly by the taxpayer.               |
| **Purpose**             | Prepayment of income tax.                   | Final tax liability determined by tax return.|
| **Applicability**       | Applies to specific payments (e.g., salaries, dividends). | Applies to an individual/entity’s total taxable income. |

---

### **How to Manage Withholding Tax**

1. **For U.S. Tax Residents**:
    - File a **W-4 form** with your employer to adjust the amount of tax withheld from your paycheck.
    - If too much is withheld, you can claim a refund when filing your tax return.

2. **For Non-U.S. Tax Residents**:
    - Submit the correct form (e.g., **W-8BEN**) to claim tax treaty benefits and reduce withholding tax rates.
    - Track withholding taxes on U.S.-sourced income (e.g., dividends, royalties) and file a U.S. tax return (Form 1040-NR) if eligible for refunds.

---

### **Conclusion**

**Withholding tax** is a mechanism to ensure taxes are collected at the point of payment, reducing the risk of non-compliance. It affects both residents and nonresidents depending on the type of income and the jurisdiction. While U.S. residents face withholding on salary and investment income, non-U.S. residents must navigate withholding tax on U.S.-sourced income, often with opportunities to reduce the rate through tax treaties and proper documentation.


# Tax withholding Adjust 

When **withholding tax** is either **less than** or **greater than** the actual tax liability that a person owes, adjustments are handled during the **tax filing process**. Here's how it works:

---

## **1. If Withholding Tax Is Less Than the Tax Owed**
If the tax withheld is **less than** the total tax the person owes, they will need to pay the remaining balance when filing their income tax return.

### **Steps for Completing the Payment (Underpayment Situation):**
1. **Calculate Total Tax Liability**:
    - When filing a tax return, the total tax liability is calculated based on the person's total taxable income and applicable tax rates.

2. **Compare Withholding to Tax Liability**:
    - The amount of tax already withheld from income is subtracted from the total tax liability.
    - If the withholding tax is **less than the actual tax owed**, the individual or entity must pay the difference.

3. **Make the Payment**:
    - The balance can be paid directly to the tax authority (e.g., **IRS** in the U.S.) through:
        - Online portals.
        - Mailing a check.
        - Bank transfers.

4. **Potential Penalties**:
    - If the underpayment is significant, the tax authority may impose **underpayment penalties** or **interest** on the unpaid amount.
    - To avoid this, taxpayers can make **quarterly estimated payments** if they expect withholding won't cover their tax liability.

---

## **2. If Withholding Tax Exceeds the Tax Owed**
If the tax withheld is **greater than** the person's total tax liability, they are entitled to a **refund** of the excess amount.

### **Steps for Claiming a Refund (Overpayment Situation):**
1. **File a Tax Return**:
    - The individual or entity must file a tax return to report their total income and calculate the actual tax liability.

2. **Compare Withholding to Tax Liability**:
    - The amount of tax already withheld is compared to the calculated tax liability.
    - If withholding exceeds the tax owed, the taxpayer is entitled to a refund.

3. **Receive the Refund**:
    - After the tax return is processed, the tax authority will issue a refund for the excess amount.
    - Refunds can typically be received via:
        - **Direct deposit** into a bank account (fastest method).
        - **Paper check** mailed to the taxpayer.
    - Processing times vary: In the U.S., refunds typically take **2-4 weeks for e-filed returns** and **6-8 weeks for mailed returns**.

4. **Adjust Future Withholdings (Optional)**:
    - If withholding regularly exceeds the tax owed, the taxpayer can adjust their withholding to avoid overpayments in the future.
    - For example, in the U.S., employees can update their **Form W-4** to modify the amount of tax withheld from their paycheck.

---

## **3. Examples**

### **Example 1: Underpayment**
- **Scenario**:
    - A person earns $100,000 in a year. Based on their income, their total tax liability is $20,000.
    - The payer (e.g., employer or bank) withheld only $17,000 during the year.
- **Outcome**:
    - The taxpayer owes the remaining $3,000 when filing their tax return.
    - If this amount is not paid by the tax due date, penalties and interest may apply.

---

### **Example 2: Overpayment**
- **Scenario**:
    - A person earns $50,000 in a year. Based on their tax liability, they owe $5,000 in taxes.
    - However, the payer withheld $6,000 during the year.
- **Outcome**:
    - The taxpayer is entitled to a refund of $1,000 after filing their tax return.
    - The IRS processes the refund, and the taxpayer receives it via direct deposit or check.

---

## **4. Special Cases**

### **4.1 For Non-U.S. Persons (Withholding Tax on U.S.-Sourced Income)**
- For foreign individuals/entities earning **U.S.-sourced income** (e.g., dividends, royalties, or interest), withholding tax is often deducted at a **default rate of 30%**.
- If withholding exceeds the actual tax liability:
    - The taxpayer can file a **U.S. tax return (Form 1040-NR)** to claim a refund for the overpaid amount.
- If withholding is less than the tax owed:
    - The taxpayer must pay the remaining balance when filing their U.S. tax return.

---

### **4.2 Quarterly Estimated Payments (Self-Employed or Insufficient Withholding)**
- If withholding is consistently insufficient (e.g., for self-employed individuals or those with substantial investment income), taxpayers may need to make **quarterly estimated payments** to cover the shortfall.
- Failure to make sufficient payments during the year can result in **penalties**.

---

## **5. Adjusting Withholding to Avoid Overpayment or Underpayment**

To avoid large refunds (overpayment) or balances due (underpayment) at tax time, taxpayers can adjust withholding:

### **In the U.S. (Form W-4)**:
- Employees can update their **Form W-4** with their employer to adjust the amount of tax withheld from their paycheck.
- For example:
    - Increase withholding to avoid underpayment.
    - Decrease withholding if too much tax is being withheld and refunds are consistently large.

### **For Non-U.S. Persons (Form W-8BEN)**:
- For non-U.S. persons receiving U.S.-sourced income, submitting a properly completed **Form W-8BEN** can reduce withholding tax based on applicable tax treaties (e.g., reducing withholding on dividends from 30% to 10% under the U.S.-China tax treaty).

---

## **6. Summary Table**

| **Situation**            | **Action Required**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Withholding < Tax Owed** | Pay the remaining balance when filing your tax return. Consider making estimated payments to avoid penalties. |
| **Withholding > Tax Owed** | File your tax return to claim a refund for the overpaid amount. Adjust future withholdings if needed.            |

---

### **Conclusion**
The tax filing process ensures that any discrepancies between withholding and actual tax liability are resolved. If withholding is insufficient, taxpayers must pay the balance owed. If withholding exceeds the tax liability, taxpayers can claim a refund. Proper planning, such as adjusting withholding amounts or making estimated payments, can help avoid surprises and penalties at tax time.

# US China Tax Treaty 1984

The **tax treaty between China and the United States**, officially called the **United States–China Income Tax Treaty (1984)**, is an agreement designed to avoid **double taxation** and prevent **tax evasion** on income. It outlines how certain types of income (like dividends, interest, royalties, and others) are taxed when earned by residents of one country from sources in the other. The treaty provides reduced withholding tax rates and other benefits to enhance cross-border economic activity.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the treaty's key provisions:

---

### **1. Key Provisions of the U.S.-China Tax Treaty**

#### **1.1 Dividends**
- **Default U.S. Tax Rate**: The default U.S. withholding tax rate on dividends paid to foreign investors is **30%**.
- **Treaty Rate**:
    - **10%** withholding tax if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of China.
    - This reduced rate applies to dividends paid by U.S. companies to Chinese residents (and vice versa for Chinese companies paying dividends to U.S. residents).

#### **1.2 Interest**
- **Default U.S. Tax Rate**: The default U.S. withholding tax rate on interest paid to foreign investors is **30%**.
- **Treaty Rate**:
    - Generally, the rate is reduced to **10%** for interest payments under the treaty.
    - Certain types of interest, such as those paid to government entities, may be **exempt from withholding tax**.

#### **1.3 Royalties**
- **Default U.S. Tax Rate**: The default U.S. withholding tax rate on royalties is **30%**.
- **Treaty Rate**:
    - **10%** withholding tax on royalties (e.g., for intellectual property, patents, trademarks, etc.).
    - Exception: Payments for the use of **industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment** are taxed at a reduced rate of **7%**.

#### **1.4 Capital Gains**
- **Taxation Rule**: Capital gains on the sale of property are generally **taxed only in the country of residence**.
    - For example, if a Chinese resident sells U.S. stocks, the capital gains are usually **not subject to U.S. tax**, unless the assets are connected to a U.S. permanent establishment or real property located in the U.S. (subject to FIRPTA rules for real estate).

#### **1.5 Business Profits**
- Business profits earned in one country (e.g., a Chinese company operating in the U.S.) are **only taxable in the other country** if the business has a **permanent establishment (PE)** in that country (e.g., a fixed office, branch, or place of management).
- If there is no PE, the income is generally taxed only in the country of residence.

#### **1.6 Employment Income**
- **Taxation Rule**: Income from employment is typically taxed in the country where the work is performed.
- **Exception**: If the individual is present in the other country for less than **183 days in a calendar year**, and the income is paid by a non-resident employer, the income may be exempt from tax in the host country.

#### **1.7 Pensions and Social Security**
- Pensions and social security benefits are generally taxed only in the country of residence.
- Special rules may apply to government pensions.

#### **1.8 Students and Teachers**
- Chinese students, trainees, and teachers who are temporarily in the U.S. for education, training, or teaching purposes may be exempt from certain U.S. taxes under the treaty (and vice versa for U.S. individuals in China).

---

### **2. Benefits of the U.S.-China Tax Treaty**

#### **2.1 Avoidance of Double Taxation**
- The treaty ensures that income is not taxed by both countries on the same basis.
- Both the U.S. and China allow taxpayers to claim a **foreign tax credit** for taxes paid to the other country.

#### **2.2 Reduced Withholding Tax Rates**
- The treaty reduces withholding taxes on dividends, interest, and royalties from the default **30%** to lower rates (e.g., **10%** or **7%**).

#### **2.3 Clarification of Taxation Rules**
- The treaty clearly defines how income like business profits, capital gains, and employment income is taxed, reducing uncertainty for cross-border taxpayers.

#### **2.4 Special Provisions for Students and Teachers**
- Students, trainees, and teachers temporarily present in the other country for education or teaching purposes may receive tax exemptions.

---

### **3. Filing Requirements to Claim Treaty Benefits**

To claim the benefits of the U.S.-China tax treaty, the following steps are typically required:

#### **3.1 For Chinese Residents Earning U.S.-Sourced Income**
- Fill out **IRS Form W-8BEN** to certify foreign status and claim treaty benefits (e.g., reduced withholding tax rates on dividends, interest, or royalties).
- Provide the form to the U.S. company or financial institution making the payment.

#### **3.2 For U.S. Residents Earning China-Sourced Income**
- File similar tax documents with Chinese tax authorities to claim treaty benefits.
- Consult a tax advisor familiar with Chinese tax regulations to ensure compliance.

#### **3.3 Reporting Obligations**
- Even if reduced withholding tax rates apply, taxpayers may still need to report the income on their tax returns in their home country and claim any applicable **foreign tax credits**.

---

### **4. Limitations and Considerations**

#### **4.1 Limitation of Benefits (LOB)**
- The treaty includes **LOB provisions**, which prevent treaty abuse. For example, only residents who meet specific criteria (e.g., substantial presence, incorporation, etc.) can claim treaty benefits.

#### **4.2 Tax Residency**
- To benefit from the treaty, you must be a **tax resident** of either the U.S. or China. Residency is determined by local tax laws (e.g., in the U.S., based on the **Substantial Presence Test** or **Green Card Test**).

#### **4.3 U.S. Citizens and Green Card Holders**
- U.S. citizens and green card holders are taxed on their **worldwide income** regardless of the treaty. However, they can use the treaty to reduce double taxation by claiming **foreign tax credits** for taxes paid in China.

#### **4.4 Treaty Override**
- The U.S. may override treaty provisions in certain situations under its **savings clause**, which allows the U.S. to tax its citizens and residents on worldwide income.

---

### **5. Example Scenarios**

#### **Example 1: Dividends**
- A Chinese investor owns shares of a U.S. company and earns $1,000 in dividends.
    - Without the treaty: U.S. withholding tax is **30%** ($300).
    - With the treaty: U.S. withholding tax is reduced to **10%** ($100).

#### **Example 2: Royalties**
- A U.S. company pays $10,000 in royalties to a Chinese company for the use of a patent.
    - Without the treaty: U.S. withholding tax is **30%** ($3,000).
    - With the treaty: U.S. withholding tax is **10%** ($1,000).

#### **Example 3: Employment Income**
- A Chinese employee works in the U.S. for 150 days in a calendar year and earns $50,000.
    - Under the treaty, if the employee is paid by a Chinese employer and meets the conditions (e.g., <183 days in the U.S.), the income may be exempt from U.S. tax.

---

### **6. Summary Table: Key Withholding Tax Rates**

| **Type of Income**         | **Default U.S. Rate** | **Treaty Rate (U.S. to China)** |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Dividends**              | 30%                  | 10%                             |
| **Interest**               | 30%                  | 10%                             |
| **Royalties (general)**    | 30%                  | 10%                             |
| **Royalties (equipment)**  | 30%                  | 7%                              |
| **Capital Gains**          | Varies               | Taxed in the country of residence (except U.S. real property). |

---

### **7. Final Notes**

The U.S.-China tax treaty provides significant benefits for cross-border taxpayers, such as reduced withholding tax rates and avoidance of double taxation. However, claiming these benefits requires proper documentation (e.g., **W-8BEN** for Chinese residents investing in the U.S.) and an understanding of the treaty's provisions. Taxpayers are encouraged to consult with a tax professional for compliance and to maximize treaty benefits.
