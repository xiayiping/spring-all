# W8 W9

The **W-9** and **W-8** forms are U.S. tax forms issued by the **Internal Revenue Service (IRS)** for different purposes, primarily related to identifying taxpayers and their tax obligations. Here's a detailed explanation of each form and their differences:

---

### **1. What Is Form W-9?**

#### **Purpose**
- The **W-9 form** is used by the IRS to gather **Taxpayer Identification Information** (TIN) from **U.S. persons** (citizens, residents, or entities).
- It is typically provided to a person or business that will pay the taxpayer (e.g., for freelance work, interest, dividends, etc.).

#### **Who Uses Form W-9?**
- **U.S. citizens**, **U.S. residents**, or **domestic entities** (corporations, partnerships, LLCs, etc.) are required to fill out a W-9 when requested by a U.S. entity.
- Common scenarios:
    - Freelancers or contractors working for a U.S. company.
    - U.S. investors earning dividends or interest from financial institutions.
    - Landlords receiving rental income.

#### **Information Provided on Form W-9**
- Legal name of the individual or entity.
- **Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN):**
    - Social Security Number (SSN) for individuals.
    - Employer Identification Number (EIN) for businesses.
- Certification of U.S. tax residency (declaring that the individual/entity is subject to U.S. tax laws).

#### **Why Is Form W-9 Important?**
- The payer (e.g., an employer, bank, or business) uses the information to report payments to the IRS (e.g., on a **1099 form** for independent contractors or for reporting interest/dividends paid to investors).
- Ensures the correct **backup withholding rate** (if applicable).

#### **Key Point**
- **Form W-9 is for U.S. persons** (citizens, residents, or entities subject to U.S. tax laws).

---

### **2. What Is Form W-8?**

#### **Purpose**
- The **W-8 series of forms** is used by the IRS to collect information from **non-U.S. persons** or entities to establish their foreign status and claim tax treaty benefits (if applicable).
- The goal is to determine the appropriate **withholding tax rate** on U.S.-sourced income paid to the non-U.S. person/entity.

#### **Who Uses Form W-8?**
- **Non-U.S. individuals or entities** receiving U.S.-sourced income (e.g., dividends, interest, royalties, or payments for services) from a U.S. company or institution.
- Common scenarios:
    - Non-U.S. investors earning dividends from U.S. stocks.
    - Non-U.S. freelancers providing services to a U.S. company.
    - Foreign licensors receiving royalties from U.S. businesses.

#### **Types of W-8 Forms**
1. **W-8BEN**:
    - For individuals.
    - Used to claim foreign status and any applicable tax treaty benefits.
    - Commonly used by foreign investors to reduce withholding tax on dividends (e.g., from 30% to 10% if a tax treaty exists).

2. **W-8BEN-E**:
    - For entities (e.g., foreign corporations or partnerships).
    - Similar to W-8BEN but tailored for organizations.

3. **W-8ECI**:
    - For non-U.S. persons or entities receiving U.S.-sourced income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (ECI).

4. **W-8EXP**:
    - For foreign governments, foreign tax-exempt organizations, or international organizations claiming exemption from U.S. withholding.

5. **W-8IMY**:
    - For intermediaries (e.g., foreign partnerships or trusts) receiving U.S.-sourced income on behalf of others.

#### **Information Provided on Form W-8**
- Name of the individual or entity.
- Country of residence.
- Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) or foreign equivalent (if applicable).
- Certification of foreign status and any applicable tax treaty benefits.

#### **Why Is Form W-8 Important?**
- It helps the payer (e.g., a U.S. company, bank, or broker) determine:
    - Whether the recipient is subject to **U.S. withholding tax**.
    - Whether the recipient qualifies for **reduced tax rates** or exemptions under a tax treaty.
- If the form is not provided, the payer may withhold tax at the default rate of **30%** on U.S.-sourced income.

#### **Key Point**
- **Form W-8 is for non-U.S. persons** (foreign individuals, entities, or governments) receiving U.S.-sourced income.

### **4. Impact on Individuals**

#### **If You Are a U.S. Person:**
- You will use **Form W-9** in most cases when working with U.S. entities or receiving U.S.-sourced income.
- No withholding tax applies unless you fail to provide a valid TIN.

#### **If You Are a Non-U.S. Person:**
- You will use a **Form W-8** (typically W-8BEN for individuals) to certify your foreign status and claim any applicable tax treaty benefits to reduce withholding tax on U.S.-sourced income.
- Failure to provide a W-8 form can result in the default **30% withholding tax** on U.S.-sourced income (e.g., dividends, royalties).
