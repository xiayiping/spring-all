### **Example: Deskewing an Image Using OpenCV**

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def deskew_image(image_path, output_path):
    # Load the image
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    if image is None:
        print("Error: Unable to read image.")
        return
    
    # Convert to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Edge detection
    edges = cv2.Canny(gray, 50, 150, apertureSize=3)
    
    # Hough Line Transform to detect lines
    lines = cv2.HoughLines(edges, 1, np.pi / 180, 200)
    
    angle = 0.0
    if lines is not None:
        angles = []
        for rho, theta in lines[:,0]:
            angle_deg = (theta * 180) / np.pi
            angles.append(angle_deg)
        
        # Compute the median angle
        median_angle = np.median(angles)
        
        # Calculate rotation angle to deskew
        if median_angle > 45:
            angle = median_angle - 90
        else:
            angle = median_angle
    else:
        print("No lines detected. Returning original image.")
        cv2.imwrite(output_path, image)
        return
    
    # Rotate the image to deskew
    (h, w) = image.shape[:2]

    # Hough Line Transform
    lines = cv2.HoughLinesP(edges, 1, np.pi / 180, threshold=100, minLineLength=100, maxLineGap=10)
    
    angles = []
    if lines is not None:
        for line in lines:
            x1, y1, x2, y2 = line[0]
            angle = np.degrees(np.arctan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1))
            angles.append(angle)
    
    if len(angles) > 0:
        median_angle = np.median(angles)
    else:
        median_angle = 0
    
    # Rotate the image to deskew
    rotated = rotate_bound(image, median_angle)
