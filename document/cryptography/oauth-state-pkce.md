# State vs PKCE

The **`state` parameter** and **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)** are both mechanisms used in OAuth2 to improve security, but they serve **different purposes** and address distinct attack vectors. Here's a detailed explanation of their differences, purpose, and how they complement each other:

---

## **What is the `state` Parameter in OAuth2?**

The `state` parameter is an optional feature defined in the OAuth2 specification. It is a **randomly generated value** that is sent with the initial authorization request and returned in the redirect response by the authorization server. Its primary purpose is to protect against **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** attacks.

### **How It Works**
1. **Client Generates a `state` Value**:
    - The client generates a random and unique value (e.g., a UUID) before making the authorization request.
    - The `state` value is stored on the client (e.g., in a session or database).

2. **Include the `state` in the Authorization Request**:
    - The `state` is sent to the authorization server as part of the authorization URL:
      ```
      https://auth.example.com/authorize?
        response_type=code&
        client_id=my-client-id&
        redirect_uri=https://myapp.com/callback&
        state=abc123xyz
      ```

3. **Authorization Server Returns the `state`**:
    - After the user authenticates and consents, the authorization server redirects back to the clientâ€™s `redirect_uri` and includes the same `state` value:
      ```
      https://myapp.com/callback?code=auth-code&state=abc123xyz
      ```

4. **Client Verifies the `state`**:
    - The client checks that the returned `state` matches the one it initially generated.
    - If the `state` doesnâ€™t match, the request is rejected as potentially malicious.

### **Purpose of the `state` Parameter**
- **CSRF Protection**: Prevents attackers from tricking a user into unknowingly authorizing an application on their behalf by ensuring the request originated from the legitimate client.
- **Identifying Sessions**: Helps correlate the redirect response to the correct user session on the client side.

## **What is PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)?**

PKCE (pronounced "pixie") is an OAuth2 extension designed to protect **authorization code flow** from **authorization code interception attacks**, especially in public clients (e.g., mobile apps, single-page apps) where a **client secret** cannot be securely stored.

### **How It Works**
1. **Client Generates a Code Verifier**:
    - The client generates a high-entropy random string (called the `code_verifier`).

2. **Transform the Code Verifier into a Code Challenge**:
    - The client applies a hashing algorithm (e.g., `SHA-256`) to the `code_verifier` to create a `code_challenge`.
    - The `code_challenge` is sent as part of the authorization request:
      ```
      https://auth.example.com/authorize?
        response_type=code&
        client_id=my-client-id&
        redirect_uri=https://myapp.com/callback&
        code_challenge=hashed-verifier&
        code_challenge_method=S256
      ```

3. **Authorization Server Stores the Code Challenge**:
    - The server associates the `code_challenge` with the authorization code it issues.

4. **Client Sends the Code Verifier During Token Exchange**:
    - When exchanging the authorization code for an access token, the client sends the original `code_verifier`:
      ```
      POST /token
      {
        "grant_type": "authorization_code",
        "code": "auth-code",
        "redirect_uri": "https://myapp.com/callback",
        "client_id": "my-client-id",
        "code_verifier": "original-random-string"
      }
      ```

5. **Authorization Server Verifies the Code Verifier**:
    - The server hashes the provided `code_verifier` and checks it against the stored `code_challenge`. If they match, the token is issued.

### **Purpose of PKCE**
- **Authorization Code Interception Protection**: Prevents an attacker from stealing the authorization code and using it to exchange for an access token without the `code_verifier`.
- **Secure Public Clients**: Eliminates the need for a client secret in applications where it cannot be securely stored (e.g., mobile or browser-based apps).

## **Key Differences Between `state` and PKCE**

| Aspect                     | `state` Parameter                                   | PKCE                                             |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                | Prevent **CSRF attacks**.                          | Prevent **authorization code interception**.    |
| **Who Generates It?**      | The client app (random value).                     | The client app (random `code_verifier`).        |
| **Where Is It Used?**      | Sent in the authorization request and redirect URI. | Sent in the authorization request and token exchange. |
| **Security Problem Solved**| Ensures the redirect is tied to the correct session. | Ensures the authorization code cannot be reused by an attacker. |
| **Hashing Required?**      | No.                                                | Yes (`SHA-256` is the recommended method).      |
| **Applies to**             | All OAuth2 flows (optional).                       | Authorization Code Flow only.                  |

## **Why Use Both `state` and PKCE?**

While `state` and PKCE solve different problems, they can and **should be used together** for maximum security:

1. **`state` for CSRF Protection**:
    - Ensures that the authorization response is tied to the correct user session and prevents attackers from injecting malicious redirects.
    - Required for all OAuth clients, regardless of whether they are public or confidential clients.

2. **PKCE for Public Client Security**:
    - Ensures that the authorization code cannot be intercepted and used by an attacker to obtain an access token.
    - Particularly crucial for public clients (e.g., mobile or JavaScript apps) where a client secret cannot be securely stored.

---

## **Example Combined Usage**
Hereâ€™s how both `state` and PKCE work together in an OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow:

1. **Authorization Request**:
   ```
   https://auth.example.com/authorize?
     response_type=code&
     client_id=my-client-id&
     redirect_uri=https://myapp.com/callback&
     state=abc123xyz&
     code_challenge=hashed-verifier&
     code_challenge_method=S256
   ```

2. **Authorization Server Redirects Back**:
   ```
   https://myapp.com/callback?code=auth-code&state=abc123xyz
   ```

3. **Client Verifies State**:
    - The client ensures the `state` matches the value it stored earlier.

4. **Token Exchange**:
   ```
   POST /token
   {
     "grant_type": "authorization_code",
     "code": "auth-code",
     "redirect_uri": "https://myapp.com/callback",
     "client_id": "my-client-id",
     "code_verifier": "original-random-string"
   }
   ```

5. **Authorization Server Verifies PKCE**:
    - The server hashes the `code_verifier` and compares it to the stored `code_challenge`.

---

## **Conclusion**

- **`state`** protects against **CSRF attacks** by ensuring the authorization response is tied to the correct session.
- **PKCE** protects against **authorization code interception** attacks by requiring proof of possession of the `code_verifier`.
- Both mechanisms address different vulnerabilities, so they are **not interchangeable** and are often used **together** in modern OAuth2 implementations.
