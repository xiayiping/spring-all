# UseEffect

In ReactJS, **`useEffect`** is a Hook that allows you to perform **side effects** in functional components. Side effects include tasks such as fetching data, manipulating the DOM, setting up subscriptions, or updating the document title. Itâ€™s a fundamental part of React's **Hooks API** and replaces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in class components.

### Syntax

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Your side effect logic here
  return () => {
    // Optional cleanup logic
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

### Parameters

1. **Effect Function**:
    - The first argument is a function where you define the side effect logic. This function is executed after the render.
    - If the effect requires cleanup (e.g., unsubscribing from an event), you can return a cleanup function from this effect.

2. **Dependency Array**:
    - The second argument is an **array of dependencies** that determines when the effect should run.
    - If a value in the array changes, the effect will re-run.
    - Common cases:
        - **Empty Array (`[]`)**: The effect runs only once after the initial render (similar to `componentDidMount`).
        - **No Array**: The effect runs after every render (default behavior).
        - **Specific Dependencies**: The effect runs whenever a dependency in the array changes.

### How `useEffect` Works

1. **Run After Render**: The effect function runs after the DOM is updated.
2. **Cleanup**: If you return a function from the effect, React will call it before running the effect again or when the component unmounts.

### Examples

#### 1. **Basic Example**
```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(`You clicked ${count} times`);
  }, [count]); // Runs whenever `count` changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

#### 2. **Fetching Data**
```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function FetchData() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((json) => setData(json));
  }, []); // Empty array ensures it runs only once

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

---

#### 3. **Cleanup Example**
```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Timer() {
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setSeconds((prev) => prev + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(interval); // Cleanup when the component unmounts
    };
  }, []); // Run only on mount

  return <div>Seconds: {seconds}</div>;
}
```

---

### Key Points to Remember

1. **Dependency Array**:
    - Controls when the effect runs. Always list all the variables that the effect depends on to avoid bugs.
    - Omitting dependencies can lead to stale values or unintended behavior.

2. **Cleanup**:
    - Always clean up subscriptions, intervals, or other resources to prevent memory leaks.
    - React calls the cleanup function before the effect is re-run or when the component is unmounted.

3. **Multiple Effects**:
    - You can use multiple `useEffect` hooks in a single component to handle different side effects independently.

---

### Common Use Cases

- Fetching data from an API
- Adding event listeners (e.g., `window.addEventListener`)
- Subscribing to WebSocket or Firebase
- Updating the document title
- Animations and timers

`useEffect` makes it easy to manage side effects in functional components while keeping your code clean and declarative.

# thread

In JavaScript, the code inside a `useEffect` hook in React is executed on the **main thread**, and its behavior in terms of event loop queuing depends on how it is scheduled. Let me break it down clearly:

---

### **1. Main Thread Execution**
- The `useEffect` hook itself is not executed during the render phase.
- Instead, the code inside `useEffect` is executed **after the render phase has completed**, as part of the **commit phase**.
- This happens asynchronously but on the **main thread**.

---

### **2. Event Loop Queuing**
The code inside `useEffect` can interact with the event loop depending on the type of operations you perform in it:

#### **a) Synchronous Code in `useEffect`**
- Any synchronous code inside `useEffect` is executed immediately after React has completed its rendering and DOM updates.
- It does not go into the event loop queues (macro or micro) because it's part of the normal execution on the main thread.

#### **b) Asynchronous Operations in `useEffect`**
- If you use asynchronous operations like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, or `Promise` inside `useEffect`, those will interact with the event loop:
    - **`setTimeout` or `setInterval`**: These are queued in the **macro-task queue**.
    - **`Promise` or `async/await`**: These go into the **micro-task queue**.

---

### **3. Macro vs. Micro Tasks**
To summarize:
- The `useEffect` function itself is executed on the **main thread**, after the render, as part of the React lifecycle.
- If there are asynchronous tasks inside `useEffect`, their placement in the event loop depends on the type of task:
    - **Micro-tasks**: Promises, `async/await`.
    - **Macro-tasks**: `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, DOM events.

---

### **Example**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Synchronous: Executed immediately on main thread");

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Macro-task: Executed later (setTimeout)");
  }, 0);

  Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log("Micro-task: Executed before macro-task");
  });
}, []);
```

**Output Order:**
1. `"Synchronous: Executed immediately on main thread"`
2. `"Micro-task: Executed before macro-task"`
3. `"Macro-task: Executed later (setTimeout)"`

---

### **Conclusion**
- `useEffect` runs on the **main thread** after rendering.
- Synchronous code inside `useEffect` executes immediately.
- Asynchronous tasks inside `useEffect` interact with the event loop, using either the **macro-task queue** (e.g., `setTimeout`) or the **micro-task queue** (e.g., Promises).
