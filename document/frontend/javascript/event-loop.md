# Event Loop

The **JavaScript Event Loop** is a fundamental concept that explains how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations and executes code, particularly in a single-threaded environment. It’s what allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking I/O operations even though it runs on a single thread.

---

### **How the Event Loop Works**

1. **JavaScript is Single-Threaded**:
    - JavaScript executes code in a single thread, meaning it can only do one task at a time in the **Call Stack**.
    - However, asynchronous operations (e.g., timers, network requests, DOM events) are offloaded, and their callbacks are queued for execution once the main thread is free.

2. **Call Stack**:
    - The **Call Stack** is a data structure where JavaScript keeps track of the function calls to be executed.
    - Functions are pushed onto the stack when called and popped off when they complete.

3. **Web APIs**:
    - When an asynchronous operation (e.g., `setTimeout`, `fetch`) is called, it is sent to the **Web APIs** provided by the browser (or Node.js APIs in a server environment).
    - These APIs handle the operation (e.g., waiting for a timer) and, once completed, send the callback to the **Callback Queue**.

4. **Callback Queue**:
    - The **Callback Queue** (or Task Queue) holds the callbacks from asynchronous operations (e.g., event listeners, timers, network requests) that are ready to be executed.

5. **Event Loop**:
    - The **Event Loop** constantly checks if the Call Stack is empty.
    - If the Call Stack is empty and there are tasks in the Callback Queue, the Event Loop pushes the first task from the Callback Queue into the Call Stack for execution.

---

### **Order of Execution**

1. **Synchronous Code**:
    - Executed first and immediately in the Call Stack.

2. **Microtasks**:
    - **Microtasks** (e.g., `Promises`, `queueMicrotask`, `MutationObserver`) have higher priority than tasks in the Callback Queue.
    - After the current Call Stack is cleared, the Event Loop processes all microtasks before moving to tasks in the Callback Queue.

3. **Tasks (Macro Tasks)**:
    - Tasks from the Callback Queue, such as `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `I/O callbacks`, are processed after the Call Stack and Microtasks are cleared.

---

### **Visualizing the Event Loop**

Let’s break down the process with an example:

#### Example Code:
```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout Callback");
}, 0);

new Promise((res, rej) =>{
    console.log("promise call")
    res(1)
}).then(() => {
  console.log("Promise Callback");
});

console.log("End");
```

#### Execution Steps:
1. **Call Stack**:
    - `"Start"` is logged immediately.
    - `setTimeout` is called, and its callback is sent to the **Callback Queue**.
    - `Promise.res` ('promise call') is called in stack, **immediately**.
    - `Promise.resolve().then()` is called, and its callback is sent to the **Microtask Queue**.
    - `"End"` is logged immediately.

2. **Microtasks**:
    - After the synchronous code finishes, the Event Loop processes the **Promise Callback** from the Microtask Queue.

3. **Callback Queue**:
    - Finally, the Event Loop processes the `setTimeout` callback from the Callback Queue.

#### Output:
```
Start
promise call
End
Promise Callback
Timeout Callback
```

### **Detailed Breakdown of Queues**

1. **Microtask Queue**:
    - Contains high-priority tasks like `Promise callbacks` and `queueMicrotask`.
    - Processed before the Callback Queue (even if tasks in the Callback Queue are ready).

2. **Callback Queue**:
    - Contains lower-priority tasks like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and I/O callbacks.
    - Processed only after the Microtask Queue is empty.

---

### **Event Loop in Action: Another Example**

#### Example Code:
```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout 1"), 10);
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout 2"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise 1");
  Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise 2"));
});

console.log("End");
```

#### Execution Steps:
1. **Synchronous Code**:
    - `"Start"` is logged.
    - `setTimeout` callbacks are sent to the Callback Queue for later execution.
    - `Promise.resolve().then()` adds its callback to the Microtask Queue.
    - `"End"` is logged.

2. **Microtasks**:
    - `Promise 1` is logged.
    - A new `Promise.resolve().then()` is added to the Microtask Queue.
    - `Promise 2` is logged.

3. **Callback Queue**:
    - `setTimeout` with `0ms` delay (`Timeout 2`) is logged.
    - `setTimeout` with `10ms` delay (`Timeout 1`) is logged.

#### Output:
```
Start
End
Promise 1
Promise 2
Timeout 2
Timeout 1
```

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Synchronous Code First**:
    - All synchronous code runs first (Call Stack).

2. **Microtasks Before Callback Queue**:
    - Microtasks like `Promise` callbacks are processed before tasks in the Callback Queue.

3. **Order of `setTimeout`**:
    - The delay in `setTimeout` is the minimum time before the callback is added to the Callback Queue, not the exact execution time.

4. **Single-threaded Execution**:
    - JavaScript executes code in a single thread, but the Event Loop enables asynchronous behavior.

### **Common Interview Questions**

1. **What’s the difference between a microtask and a macrotask?**
    - **Microtask**: Higher priority tasks processed after the current stack (e.g., `Promise.then`, `queueMicrotask`).
    - **Macrotask**: Lower priority tasks processed after microtasks (e.g., `setTimeout`, `setInterval`).

2. **Why does `Promise` resolve before `setTimeout`?**
    - Promises are part of the Microtask Queue, which is processed before the Callback Queue (where `setTimeout` resides).

3. **What is the Event Loop?**
    - The Event Loop is a mechanism that processes the Call Stack, Microtask Queue, and Callback Queue to execute JavaScript code asynchronously.

# setTimeout in Promise

The purpose of putting `setTimeout` inside a `Promise` is to create a **delayed asynchronous operation** that can be handled with `.then()` or `await`. This approach is often used when you want to simulate or handle time-dependent asynchronous tasks in JavaScript, such as waiting for a specific period of time before resolving or rejecting the promise.

---

### **Explanation of the Code**

Here’s the code you provided (slightly corrected for syntax clarity):

```javascript
new Promise((res) => {
    return setTimeout(() => {
        return res(1);
    }, 1000);
});
```

- **`new Promise`**: Creates a promise object, which represents a value that will be resolved (or rejected) in the future.
- **`setTimeout`**: Used to delay the execution of the code inside it by a specified time (in this case, `1000` ms or 1 second).
- **`res(1)`**: Resolves the promise with the value `1` after the delay.

### **Why use `setTimeout` inside a Promise?**

1. **Simulating Delays in Asynchronous Operations**:
   - If you want to simulate an asynchronous process that takes some time (e.g., waiting for an API response), you can use `setTimeout` inside a `Promise`. For example:
     ```javascript
     function simulateApiCall() {
         return new Promise((resolve) => {
             setTimeout(() => {
                 resolve("API response");
             }, 2000); // Simulates a 2-second delay
         });
     }

     simulateApiCall().then((response) => {
         console.log(response); // Output: "API response" after 2 seconds
     });
     ```

2. **Creating a Delay or Timeout Utility**:
   - Using `setTimeout` inside a `Promise` is a common pattern for creating delay utilities. For example:
     ```javascript
     function delay(ms) {
         return new Promise((resolve) => {
             setTimeout(resolve, ms);
         });
     }

     delay(1000).then(() => {
         console.log("1 second has passed");
     });
     ```

3. **Ensuring Code Runs After a Delay**:
   - If you want to ensure that some code is executed only after a delay (and you want to use `await` or `.then()`), putting `setTimeout` in a `Promise` allows you to do this cleanly:
     ```javascript
     async function delayedTask() {
         console.log("Starting...");
         await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000)); // Wait 3 seconds
         console.log("Finished after 3 seconds");
     }

     delayedTask();
     ```

4. **Chaining Asynchronous Operations**:
   - Promises allow chaining via `.then()` or use with `async/await`, making them more flexible than plain callbacks. For example:
     ```javascript
     new Promise((resolve) => {
         setTimeout(() => resolve("Step 1 complete"), 1000);
     })
         .then((result) => {
             console.log(result); // Logs: "Step 1 complete"
             return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve("Step 2 complete"), 1000));
         })
         .then((result) => {
             console.log(result); // Logs: "Step 2 complete"
         });
     ```

### **Key Benefit of Using Promise with `setTimeout`**

The primary benefit is that it integrates the asynchronous delay (`setTimeout`) into the **Promise-based workflow**, allowing you to:

- Chain `.then()` calls.
- Use `await` for cleaner asynchronous code.
- Avoid callback hell that often happens with plain `setTimeout`.

---

### **Potential Issues**

1. **Return Value of `setTimeout`**:
   - Note that the `setTimeout` function itself returns a timer ID, **not a promise**. However, the `Promise` ensures that the logic inside `setTimeout` resolves the promise when the timer completes.

2. **Unnecessary `return` Statements**:
   - In your code:
     ```javascript
     new Promise((res) => {
         return setTimeout(() => {
             return res(1);
         }, 1000);
     });
     ```
     The `return` statements are unnecessary and can be safely removed. For example:
     ```javascript
     new Promise((res) => {
         setTimeout(() => {
             res(1);
         }, 1000);
     });
     ```

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If an error occurs inside the `setTimeout` callback, it won’t automatically reject the promise unless you explicitly handle it. For example:
     ```javascript
     new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         setTimeout(() => {
             try {
                 throw new Error("Something went wrong");
             } catch (error) {
                 reject(error);
             }
         }, 1000);
     })
         .catch((err) => console.error(err)); // Logs the error
     ```

---

### **Conclusion**

Using `setTimeout` inside a `Promise` is a common way to introduce delays in asynchronous code. It allows you to integrate timeouts into the promise/async-await workflow, making it easier to handle delayed or time-dependent operations.
