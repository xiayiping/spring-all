# Xhr advantage over fetch

Using the **JavaScript `fetch` API** instead of **XMLHttpRequest (XHR)** has several advantages due to its modern, promise-based design. However, there are also **disadvantages or limitations** of `fetch` compared to XHR, especially in specific scenarios involving remote HTTP servers.

---

### **Disadvantages of Using `fetch` vs. `XMLHttpRequest`**

#### 1. **No Built-In Support for Progress Events**
- **Fetch Limitation**: The `fetch` API does not natively support progress events for monitoring upload or download progress (e.g., `onprogress` in XHR). You need to use workarounds like `ReadableStream` for downloading progress, which can be more complex.
- **When It Matters**: If your application needs to provide real-time progress updates for large file uploads or downloads, XHR is simpler and more effective.
- **Example in XHR**:
  ```javascript
  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open('POST', '/upload');
  xhr.upload.onprogress = (event) => {
    if (event.lengthComputable) {
      const percentComplete = (event.loaded / event.total) * 100;
      console.log(`Upload progress: ${percentComplete}%`);
    }
  };
  xhr.send(file);
  ```

#### 2. **Lack of Timeout Support**
- **Fetch Limitation**: Fetch does not natively support request timeouts. If the server takes too long to respond, `fetch` will hang indefinitely unless you manually implement a timeout using `AbortController` or similar techniques.
- **When It Matters**: For remote servers that may be slow or unreliable, managing timeouts is critical to prevent the app from freezing or waiting indefinitely.
- **XHR Advantage**:
  ```javascript
  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open('GET', '/slow-endpoint');
  xhr.timeout = 5000; // Timeout after 5 seconds
  xhr.ontimeout = () => {
    console.log('Request timed out!');
  };
  xhr.send();
  ```

---

#### 3. **Less Control Over Requests**
- **Fetch Limitation**: Fetch is designed to be simpler and more modern, but it sacrifices some of the fine-grained control that XHR provides:
    - Fetch does not allow you to abort a request mid-response unless you use `AbortController`.
    - Fetch automatically converts some HTTP errors (e.g., HTTP 404 or 500) into resolved promises unless you manually check `response.ok`.
- **When It Matters**: For applications requiring low-level control over HTTP requests or responses (e.g., custom headers or response handling), XHR offers more direct features.

---

#### 4. **Cross-Origin Cookies Handling**
- **Fetch Limitation**: Fetch does not send cookies by default for cross-origin requests unless you explicitly set the `credentials` option to `'include'` or `'same-origin'`.
- **When It Matters**: If your application relies on cookies for authentication with remote servers, this behavior may cause issues unless properly configured.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  // Fetch requires explicit credentials setting
  fetch('https://example.com/api', {
    credentials: 'include',
  });
  ```

---

#### 5. **Older Browser Support**
- **Fetch Limitation**: Fetch is not supported in older browsers, such as Internet Explorer, without a polyfill.
- **When It Matters**: If your application needs to support legacy browsers, XHR is a safer choice.

---

#### 6. **Streaming Responses Are Complex**
- **Fetch Limitation**: While Fetch supports `ReadableStream` for streaming responses, it is more complex to use compared to XHR for simple streaming tasks.
- **When It Matters**: If you are dealing with streaming large amounts of data (e.g., video files or chunked JSON), XHR may be simpler, though Fetch can achieve the same functionality with more effort.

---

#### 7. **CORS Handling**
- **Fetch Limitation**: Fetch is stricter when dealing with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). If the server does not properly implement CORS headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`), Fetch will fail outright, whereas XHR might allow more flexibility in certain cases.
- **When It Matters**: For poorly configured remote servers, XHR may behave more leniently than Fetch.

### **When to Use `fetch` vs. `XHR`**

| Use Case                               | Use `fetch`                          | Use `XHR`                              |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Basic GET/POST requests                | ✅ Simpler, modern API                | ❌ Overly verbose                      |
| File uploads with progress tracking    | ❌ Requires workarounds               | ✅ Native `onprogress` support         |
| File downloads with progress tracking  | ❌ Complex with `ReadableStream`      | ✅ Native `onprogress` support         |
| Timeout handling                       | ❌ Requires `AbortController`         | ✅ Native `timeout` property           |
| Cross-origin requests with cookies     | ✅ Explicit with `credentials` option | ✅ Cookies sent by default             |
| Streaming large data                   | ✅ Supported (but complex)            | ✅ Simpler for basic needs             |
| Older browser support                  | ❌ Requires polyfill                  | ✅ Works out of the box                |
| Strict CORS handling                   | ✅ Enforces stricter policies         | ❌ More lenient in some cases          |
| Need fine-grained control              | ❌ Less control than XHR              | ✅ Full control (headers, events, etc.)|

### **Conclusion**
- Use **`fetch`** for most modern applications where:
    - Simplicity and readability are important.
    - You do not need progress tracking or low-level control.
    - You can manage timeouts and advanced features with additional code (e.g., `AbortController`).

- Use **`XHR`** for:
    - Applications requiring **progress events** (e.g., file uploads/downloads).
    - **Timeout-sensitive tasks** without implementing custom logic.
    - Legacy browser support or edge cases where fine-grained control over HTTP requests is needed.
